class TimeStepSpec(metaclass=_TimeStepSpecMeta):
    """
    A class to specify time steps for simulation output.

    This class allows for flexible specification of time steps using slices
    or individual indices. Its custom metaclass provides a [] operator on the class itself
    for slicing and the () operator for choosing the unit such that the most convenient
    way to use it is as follows:

        ts = TimeStepSpec[:12:2, 7]("steps") + TimeStepSpec[1.e-15:5.e-15:2.e-16]("seconds")

    In this example, `ts` specifies:
    - every other time step for the first 12 time steps inclusively (`0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12`)
    - AND the 7th time step
    - AND one output every 2.e-16 seconds in the (inclusive) range 1.e-15 to 5.e-15 seconds
      (which indices this maps to depends on the time step size and the number of time steps)

    In general, the class implements the following semantics for the operator []:
    - the [] operator understands slices and numbers separated by commas
    - specifications separated by commas are interpreted as unions
    - slices are interpreted as inclusive on both ends, so `start:stop:step` includes the values
      `start` and `stop` (if there exists an integer n such that `n*step+start == stop`)
    - negative values are allowed for `start` and `stop` but not `step` (due to practical limitations
      of the simulation code); as expected in Python they count from the end but due to inclusiveness
      `:-1` includes the last element
    - individual numbers denote a single time step
    - multiple specifications (particularly in different units) can be concatenated (as set unions)
      via the + operator

    Default units are `steps`. If other units are given (see which are implemented in `TimeStepUnits`),
    rounding must happen in the translation into steps (the only unit available in the backend). This
    rounding is implemented to round down (up) for the lower (upper) bound such that the interval will
    never be clipped. The time step is always rounded down to the next available multiple of the time
    step size, such that for long and sparsely sampled intervals distortions may occur.

    An extensive list of tests is available in the corresponding directory, mapping the syntax to
    concrete index sets. The reader is encouraged to look for clarification there.
