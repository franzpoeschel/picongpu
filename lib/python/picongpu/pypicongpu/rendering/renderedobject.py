    Class to be inherited from for rendering context generation

    Every object that intends to generate a rendering context (typically as a
    dict) must inherit from this class and implement _get_serialized().

    It is expected that _get_serialized() fully encodes the internal state,
    i.e. two equal (==) objects also return an equal result for
    _get_serialized().

    For external usage, the method get_rendering_context() is provided.
    It passes _get_serialized() through, checking its result against a
    predefined json schema. If this schema is not fullfilled/not available,
    an error is raised.
