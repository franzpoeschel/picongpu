    """
    unmodifiable property of a species

    Equal for all macroparticles, e.g. mass, charge, ionization levels etc.
    Owned by **exactly one** species.

    PIConGPU term: "particle flags"

    Parent class for actual SpeciesConstants

    A Constant can have the following dependencies:

    - species objects

        - dependency species must be available for the init manager
        - code for dependency species will be generated *before* the code for
          this species

    - attributes (types)

        - dependency attributes must be generated by *any* property on the
          species with this constant
        - there are no further checks employed, the constant is never shown the
          concrete attribute object of its species

    - constants (types)

        - dependency constants must be present before the initmanager performs
          any actions
        - checks on the value of constants are not possible, only if a constant
          of a given type is present
        - (the concrete constant that is being checked is never passed to this
          constant)
