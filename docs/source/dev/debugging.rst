Debugging
=========

When investigating the reason of a crashing simulation, it is very helpful to reduce the setup as much as possible while the crash is still happening.
This includes moving to fewer (and ideally to 1) MPI processes, having minimal grid size (ideally 3 supercells), disabling unrelated plugins and simulation stages.
Such a reduction should be done incrementally while checking whether the issue is still observed.
Knowing when the issue disappears could hint to its source.
This process also significantly speeds up and helps to focus a following deeper look.

The following build options can assist the investigation:

* ``PIC_VERBOSE=<N>`` sets log detail level for PIConGPU, highest level is 127.
* ``PMACC_VERBOSE=<N>`` sets log detail level for pmacc, highest level is 127.
* ``PMACC_BLOCKING_KERNEL=ON`` makes each kernel invocation blocking, which helps to narrow a crash down to a particular kernel.
* ``PMACC_ASYNC_QUEUES=OFF`` disables asynchronous alpaka queues, also helps to narrow a crash down to a particular place.
* ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`` compile in debug mode where all assertions are activated. Compiling in debug mode will slowdown your kernels!

These options can be passed when building, or manually modified via cmake.
An example build command is

.. code:: bash

   pic-build -c "-DPIC_VERBOSE=127 -DPMACC_VERBOSE=127 -DPMACC_BLOCKING_KERNEL=ON -DPMACC_ASYNC_QUEUES=OFF"


If you encounter an error during reading or writing of openPMD files, it can be helpful to run openPMD-api with verbose output.
This can be done by setting the following environment variable either in your environment (e.g. ``picongpu.profile``) or in your submit script ``./tbg/submit.start`` before executing ``picongpu``.

.. code:: bash

   export OPENPMD_VERBOSE=1


Additionally, you can activate IO logging in PIConGPU by adding the login level ``32``.
This can be done via command flags (see above) when using ``pic-build```or via ``ccmake .`` in the ``.build`` directory.
To debug the performance of openPMD output in PIConGPU, set the CMake variable ``PIC_OPENPMD_TIMETRACE_NUMBER_OF_FILES`` to ``1`` to obtain detailed time information about the I/O steps.

When reporting a crash, it is helpful if you attached the output ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` of such a build.
